## THE CARD GAME

This is a card presentation of players that participate in a card game.
The game is a single page application where all actions and visualizations are shown on one page, targeting desktop environments.
Once a card from the overview is selected it's full information is shown in the details view and highlighted to indicate what is
currently selected.
The cards are able to be sorted by name in ascending / descending order via the controls section.
A currently selected card's contents can be submitted via mocked AJAX request.
